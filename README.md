## Description 

Datalibweb is an API data platform specifically designed to enable users to access the most up-to-date data and documentation available in different regiona catalogs at the World Bank. It allows users to access the latest and historical versions of non-harmonized (original/raw) data as well as different harmonized collections across across Global Practices. It is integrated with Stata through the Datalibweb Stata package.

{p 4 4 2} {cmd:datalibweb} is developed to facilitate the access of the ex-post
harmonization and not-harmonized (original or raw) data produced and gathered by the regional teams in the Poverty Global Practice.
Please use with {cmd: CAUTION} and please remember to follow the
{help datalibweb##termsofuse:TERMS OF USE}!! {p_end}

{p 4 4 2}Access to the harmonized or original dataset is not given to users automatically unless the dataset is marked with Public access. 
Users need to contact regional/collection focal points and ask for the permission. Each user will have different sets of subscription to the survey.
